# RPI Ambulance's Slack integrations
There are a number of integrations included in this Node.js file, intended to ease logistics and information-sharing of RPI Ambulance members. Read on to find out more.

## AmIResponding?

This integration was the origin of this entire project. AIR provides [IamResponding](https://iamresponding.com/v3/Pages/Default.aspx)-type functionality for free and within a Slack team. It utilizes Slack's [bot users API](https://api.slack.com/bot-users) to post an [interactive message](https://api.slack.com/interactive-messages) when a call is dispatched.

This interactive message posts some information about the call and queries channel members if they're responding or not. It then posts each person's response for the channel to see.

Here's how a dispatch looks in Slack—with a few people who responded to the call:

## `/whoson` slash command
With no parameters passed to it, this integration provides the RPI Ambulance crew schedule for:
* The current crew, between 1800 and 0600 hours
* The previous night's crew and tonight's crew, between 0600 and 0900 hours
* Tonight's crew, between 0900 and 1800 hours

These differences provide a logical and grammatically accurate description of the status of night crews. The time between 0600 and 0900 hours was specifically selected because the previous night's crew will often still respond to emergency calls—even after their "shift" ended.

When adding a parameter, one can receive the scheduled crew for any day from the previous day to one week in the future. For example:
* `/whoson yesterday`
* `/whoson mon`
* `/whoson Thursday`
* `/whoson SAT`

Capitalization does not matter for the parameters, but one must currently type the entire day of the week (or its common abbreviation), spelled correctly.

## RPI*Alert*
The RPI*Alert* system provides audible, SMS, and email notifications to the RPI campus during high-priority, critical, rapidly changing events. Several systems have been set up to work with RPI*Alert*, including [Concerto Emergency](https://github.com/concerto-addons/concerto_emergency), most of which utilize RPI*Alert*'s public RSS feed.

This Slack integration uses the RSS feed, as well, and forwards the alert to everybody on the #alerts channel, a channel specifically intended to never be muted.

For good measure, here's how an alert looks in the channel:
